Xanthomonas has a limited survival period of days to weeks in the soil. Secondary infection can occur through rain or overhead irrigation. It enters the plant tissues through leaf pores and wounds. Optimal temperatures range from 25 to 30째C for the bacterial spot. Once the crop is infected, the disease is very difficult to control and can lead to total crop losses.

The fungus thrives in moist conditions and can spread quickly in humid environments  \nWarm temperatures: Warm temperatures (around 70-75째F) also create ideal conditions for the growth and spread of tomato leaf mold. The fungus can rapidly reproduce in warm weather and can cause significant damage to the tomato plants.  \nOverhead watering: Overhead watering can contribute to the development and spread of tomato leaf mold. When the foliage of the tomato plants gets wet, it creates a moist environment that is favorable for the growth of the fungus.  \nPoor air circulation: Poor air circulation can also contribute to the development of tomato leaf mold.

Water the plants at the base, and avoid getting the leaves wet while watering. Also, avoid overhead watering, especially during humid conditions.  \nProvide good air circulation: Good air circulation helps to reduce humidity around the plants, making it less conducive for fungal growth.
